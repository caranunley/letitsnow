# You Will Know

Using Sonic Pi, I played around with various chords and structures. I was working with a couple of different paces After a lot of trial and error, I settled on making a sound that was both educational and christmasy! In this work, I focused on making a riff off of Let It Snow to get into the holiday spirit. I used loops to simplify my code as well as defined methods to play various different parts of the song! 

I experiemented with using a randomization element to give variations to the music, allowing the verses and choruses to switch back and forth. But eventually, I liked the traditional melody to go along with my lyrics and video as well. I knew I wanted to focus on something that would be helpful for students in CS 1101. So, I was thinking of a slower song that would be able to clearly get my message across. So, I started playing with BPM that were a bit of the more relaxed and slower side. I thought that it would be easier for a listener to understand what I was articulating if the melody was a bit slower. I also know that it is easier for me to remember lyrics to a melody I already know. So here I wanted to have a familiar song that I could change the lyrics to â€“ to be more memorable. 

I also recognize that we are getting into the holiday spirit as it is December! So, I also wanted to include something fun and festive. I concluded with trying to replicate Let It Snow! I thought this would be a fun song that is slow and well known for students to hear. 

For my lyrics, I focused on doing an overview of a few topics. I touched on topics that I thought were confusing and hard concepts to grasp when I was just starting to learn computer science. I focused on recursion, if and else statements, Booleans, and while and for loops! I hope you enjoy!!!
