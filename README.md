# LetMeKnow

Using Sonic Pi, I played around with various chords and structures. I was working with a couple of different paces After a lot of trial and error, I settled on making a sound that was both educational and christmasy! In this work, I focused on making a riff off of Let It Snow to get into the holiday spirit. I used loops to simplify my code as well as defined methods to play various different parts of the song! 

I experiemented with using a randomization element to give variations to the music, allowing the verses and choruses to switch back and forth. But eventually, I liked the traditional melody to go along with my lyrics and video as well.
